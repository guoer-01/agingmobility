This code aims to quantify and analyse service accessibility (the first key metric: **A**) and the corresponding disparity between different popualtion groups (the second key metric: **fairness index**) by using demographical and mobile data (sample data provided for testing: [SampleData](/SampleData). The two key metrics are first calculated followed by the main analyses and visualization. This code is run using Python.
